# Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## How It Works
- If the discount is **20% or higher**, the program applies the discount.
- If the discount is **less than 20%**, the program returns the original price.

## Usage
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python discount_calculator.py
Enter the original price when prompted.

Enter the discount percentage.

The program will display either:

The discounted price (if discount â‰¥ 20%), or

The original price (if discount < 20%).
yaml 
Example
Enter the original price: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
The final price after applying a 25% discount is: 75.0
